# Chinese Character Writing Trajectory Optimization
For my optimization class, I created a Chinese character trajectory optimization tool inspired Inspired by a trajectory learning algorithm used on RC helicopters. Tools used: Jupyter, Unity

## Description

For full explanation and references, see [pdf documentation](https://github.com/JamesG4321/Chinese-Character-Writing-Trajectory-Optimization/blob/main/Chinese%20Character%20Writing%20Trajectory%20Optimization%20James%20Guo.pdf).

## Unity Handwriting Recorder

The data collection of handwriting trajectory was built in unity. The tool can be [found here](https://github.com/JamesG4321/Chinese-Character-Writing-Trajectory-Optimization/tree/main/WritngRecorder).

## Data Processing

The data processing of this project uses a Jupyter notebook written by me. The notebook can be [found here](https://github.com/JamesG4321/Chinese-Character-Writing-Trajectory-Optimization/blob/main/EE_546_handwriting_project_James_Guo.ipynb).
